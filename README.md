I'm Daniel De Lucca, a seasoned Software Architect with a passion for building scalable, high-performance applications.
My journey in tech has taken me from co-founding startups to leading engineering teams at some of Brazil's top unicorns, like [@quintoandar](https://github.com/quintoandar) and [@neon](https://github.com/neon).
Currently, I'm driving innovation as a Lead Software Architect at [@trilonio](https://github.com/trilonio), where we‚Äôre transforming the e-commerce landscape for industrial parts distribution.

Beyond my professional work, I'm deeply committed to the open-source community.
I've contributed to projects like [@nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs), [@chia](https://github.com/Chia-Network), and [@kubeless](https://github.com/vmware-archive/kubeless), collaborating with talented developers worldwide to push the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not coding or architecting systems, you'll likely find me exploring the great outdoors, hiking new trails, or enjoying the company of my three loyal dogs üê∂
